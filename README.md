# Nvim
A simple nvim config folder.

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to bring in some useful functionality without making it too complex.

Features include:
+ Tokyonight theme
+ Nvim tree
+ Barbar
+ Lualine
+ Telescope

(All configured with easy to use keybindings, which you can change as you please)

For those new to this:

+ 1st, Install Neovim & git with the package manager of your choice ( mine is pacman, coz I use Arch btw :) ):

```
$ sudo pacman -S neovim
```

and

```
$ sudo pacman -S git
```

+ 2nd, Create the ```nvim/``` folder in your ```.config/``` folder
+ 3rd, ```cd``` into ```nvim``` and clone the code from my repo from within with:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Joe-BN/Nvim/config
```

 Enjoy     : )
